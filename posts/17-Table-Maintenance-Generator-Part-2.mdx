## Introduction
Welcome back to our discussion on the **Table Maintenance Generator (TMG)**. In our previous video, we generated the TMG using the one-step method. Today, we will focus on how to maintain data in the table using the TMG we created. We will be using transaction code **SM30** for this purpose.

---

## Step 1: Accessing the Table Maintenance Screen

1. **Open Transaction SM30**
   - Start by entering transaction code **SM30** in the command field.
   - Enter the name of the table for which you generated the TMG and click on the **Maintain** button.

2. **Viewing Existing Entries**
   - You should see the existing entries in the table. In this case, there are already three entries present.

---

## Step 2: Inserting New Data

1. **Adding New Entries**
   - To insert new data, click on the **New Entries** button.
   - Fill in the fields for the new record:
     - **Order Number:** 4
     - **Order Date:** (Select a date)
     - **Payment Mode:** (Choose from the dropdown, e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, Net Banking)
     - **Total Amount:** (Enter an amount)
     - **Currency:** (Select the currency, e.g., INR)

2. **Inserting Multiple Records**
   - You can insert additional records by repeating the process. For example, create another entry with:
     - **Order Number:** 5
     - **Payment Mode:** (Choose another option)
     - **Total Amount:** (Enter an amount)
     - **Currency:** (Select the currency)

3. **Saving the Entries**
   - After entering the new records, click on the **Save** button. You should see a confirmation message, and the number of records in the table should now reflect the new entries.

---

## Step 3: Deleting and Changing Records

1. **Deleting Records**
   - To delete records, select the entries you want to remove and click on the **Minus** button. 
   - After confirming the deletion, click **Save** to finalize the changes.

2. **Changing Existing Records**
   - To change a specific value (e.g., changing the payment mode from Debit Card to Credit Card), select the record and make the necessary changes.
   - Click **Save** to apply the changes. Remember, you can only change non-primary key data.

## Step 4: Understanding the Overview Screen

1. **Overview Screen in One Step**
   - In the one-step method, you only have one type of screen, which is the **Overview Screen**. 
   - To check the screen number, click on the **Maintain** button, then go to **System > Status**. You will see that the screen number is 1.

2. **Consistent Screen Number**
   - Even when adding new entries, the screen number remains the same (1) because the one-step method only allows for an overview screen.

---

## Step 5: Generating the Table Maintenance Generator Using Two Steps

1. **Deleting the One-Step TMG**
   - If you want to explore more options, you can delete the TMG generated using the one-step method.

2. **Generating TMG Using Two Steps**
   - Navigate to **Utilities > Table Maintenance Generator** and enter the same table name in the function group.
   - Select **Two Step** and find the screen number. You will notice that both the overview screen and the single screen are now applicable.

3. **Creating the TMG**
   - Click on **Create** and save your changes. You should see a message indicating that the request was completed successfully.

## Conclusion
In this session, we learned how to maintain data in a table using the TMG generated through the one-step method. We also explored how to delete and change records. Additionally, we discussed the differences between generating a TMG using one step versus two steps. In our next video, we will continue to explore the differences in functionality when using the two-step TMG. Thank you for your attention!
