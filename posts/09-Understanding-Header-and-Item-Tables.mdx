Today, we will look into a fundamental concept in SAP that underpins the structure of data management across various modules: the relationship between header and item tables. This concept is crucial for understanding how data is organized and accessed in SAP, and it applies to all major modules, including Sales and Distribution (SD), Materials Management (MM), and Financial Accounting (FI).

### What are Header and Item Tables? 

Header tables contain general information about a document or transaction, while item tables store detailed information about each item related to that document. Think of it like a grocery bill:

1. **Header Information:** This includes the shop name, customer name, date, time, payment mode, and bill number. This information is essential to identify the transaction as a whole.

2. **Item Information:** This includes the list of items purchased, such as item names, quantities, and prices. Each item is linked to the header information, which provides context to the transaction.

**Key Concept:** **Dependency** Itâ€™s important to note that items are dependent on the header. Without a header, there cannot be any items. This relationship is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that all items are associated with a specific transaction.
