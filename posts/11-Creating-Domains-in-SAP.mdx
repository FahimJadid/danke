By the end of this, you will understand how to create domains in SAP using the transaction code SE11. You will learn the importance of domains, their attributes, and how to ensure they are properly activated for use.

### Introduction to Domains

#### What is a Domain?

- A domain defines the technical characteristics of a field in a database table, such as its data type, length, and value ranges. Domains ensure that data entered into the system adheres to specific formats and constraints.

#### Why Create Domains?

- Domains help maintain data integrity and consistency across the SAP system, making it easier to manage and validate data.
