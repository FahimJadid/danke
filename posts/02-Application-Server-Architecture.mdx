### Dispatcher
- All requests that come in from Presentation servers are directed first to Dispatcher
- The Dispatcher writes them first to the Dispatcher queue
- The dispatcher pulls the requests from the queue on a first-in, first-ot basis

### Work Process
- Each request from the dispatcher is then allocated to the first available work process 
- A work process handles one request at a time
- A work process needs to address two special memory areas - the user context and the program roll area

### User Context
- The user context is a memory area that contains information about the user
- When a user logs on, a user context is allocated for that logon
- When a user log off, it is freed

### Roll Area
- Roll area is a memory area that contains information about the programs execution
- When a program runs, a roll area is allocated for that program
- The roll area is freed when the program ends

### SAP system landscape
SAP system landscape consists of 3 systems
    - Development
    - Quality
    - Production

### Development
- It is used for all developments and configurations.
- The developments and configurations move from development system to quality system through a mechanism called as transport request.

### Quality
- The testing of all the developments and customizations needs be done in the quality system.
- The developments and configurations move from quality system to production system through transport request.

### Production
- It is also called as live system or customer based system.
- Customer runs his business through production system.
