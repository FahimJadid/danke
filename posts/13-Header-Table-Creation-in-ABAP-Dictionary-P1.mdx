## Introduction
Welcome to today's tutorial on **Creating an Order Header Table** in SAP. In this session, we will learn how to create a database table using previously created domains and data elements. This will provide a structured way to store order-related data.

---

## Step 1: Accessing Table Creation

1. **Open SAP GUI:** Launch your SAP GUI and log in.
2. **Enter Transaction Code:** Type **SE11** in the command field and press **Enter**.
3. **Select Database Table:** Choose the first radio button labeled "Database Table".

---

## Step 2: Naming the Table

1. **Table Name:** Enter a meaningful name for the table, such as **`ZORDER_HEADER`** (using 'Z' to indicate a custom object).
2. **Short Description:** Provide a description for the table, such as **"Order Header Table"**.

---

## Step 3: Setting Table Attributes

1. **Delivery Class:**
   - Select a delivery class from the available options. For this tutorial, choose **Option "A"**.
   
2. **Data Browser/Table View Editing Options:**
   - Choose the option **"Display Maintenance Allowed"** for the data browser/table view editing.

## Step 4: Adding Fields to the Table

### Adding the First Column: Client Number

1. **Navigate to Fields Tab:** Click on the "Fields" tab to add columns to the table.
2. **First Field Name:** Enter **`MANDT`** for the client number.
3. **Assign Data Element:** Assign the data element **`MANDT`** to this field.
   - Note: The data element **`MANDT`** starts with "M", indicating it is a SAP standard data element with a domain of type **CL** (Client) and length **D3**.
4. **Significance of Client Number:** This field will automatically take the client number of the SAP system (e.g., 800).

---

### Adding the Second Column: Order Number

1. **Second Field Name:** Enter **`ONO`** for the order number.
2. **Assign Data Element:** Assign the previously created data element for order number to this field.
   - Note: The name does not need to start with 'Z' or 'Y', but it should be meaningful and concise.

---

### Adding the Third Column: Order Date

1. **Third Field Name:** Enter **`ORDER_DATE`** for the order date.
2. **Assign Data Element:** Assign the data element created for order date.
   - The length and type from the domain will be automatically applied.

### Adding the Fourth Column: Payment Mode

1. **Fourth Field Name:** Enter **`PAYMENT_MODE`** for the payment mode.
2. **Assign Data Element:** Assign the data element created for payment mode.
   - The character length of one will be automatically applied.

### Adding the Sixth Column: Currency

1. **Sixth Field Name:** Enter **`CURRENCY`** for the currency.
2. **Assign Data Element:** Assign the data element created for currency.

## Step 5: Finalizing Table Creation

1. **Review Table Structure:** Ensure all fields have been added correctly with their respective data elements.
2. **Save the Table:** Press **Control + S** to save the table structure.
3. **Check Syntax:** Press **Control + F2** to check for any syntax errors.
4. **Activate the Table:** Press **Control + F3** to activate the table.
